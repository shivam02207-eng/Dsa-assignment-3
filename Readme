Campus Navigation & Utility Planner
Overview
This project implements a complete Campus Navigation & Utility Planner using fundamental data structures and algorithms.
It includes:

Building ADT

Binary Search Tree (BST)

AVL Tree (Self-balancing BST)

Graph (Adjacency List + Adjacency Matrix)

BFS & DFS Traversals

Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

Expression Tree for evaluating arithmetic expressions

The project is written in Python and designed to match the specifications provided in the assignment PDF.

Features Implemented
1. Building ADT
Each building stores:

Building ID

Name

Location

All connected buildings with distances

2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
Implementations include:

Insert nodes

Search a building by ID

Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals

Height calculation

3. AVL Tree
Automatically balances the tree

Supports LL, RR, LR, RL rotations

Efficient O(log n) search and insert

Same traversal operations as BST

4. Graph Implementation
Both forms are supported:

Adjacency List

Adjacency Matrix

Graph supports:

Adding buildings

Adding weighted edges (distances between buildings)

5. Graph Traversals
Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

6. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Finds the shortest path between any two campus buildings.

7. Kruskal’s Algorithm
Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Union-Find data structure.

8. Expression Tree
Evaluates postfix expressions using a binary expression tree.
